-Engineered and implemented a new statistical metric, aFIP (adjusted FIP), refining traditional FIP and xFIP by incorporating additional hit types such as infield fly balls, line drives, and ground balls.
-Applied regression analysis to quantitatively demonstrate aFIP's improvement over FIP and xFIP in predicting future ERAs, providing statistical evidence in the form of correlation and RMSE for its enhanced accuracy and effectiveness.
-Utilized advanced statistical modeling techniques to create aFIP, showcasing expertise in sabermetric principles and nuanced player performance analysis.
